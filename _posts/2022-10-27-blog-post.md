Thoughts from day 1 of ASHG 2022.

ASHG 2022 at the LA Convention Center
------

Day one was mostly about coordinating the commute to LACC and attending industry talks in the exhibit hall. Although I drove up and parked in the Expo/Sepulveda metro station parking before riding the E line to LACC, I realized later I can take the CC6 bus that I normally take to UCLA straight to the station in the future. In the future I'll have to try taking the connection from the 7th street station to Long beach.

Golden Helix Colab
------

These were not actually Google Colab workshop sessions. "Colabs" are the name they gave to 30 minute industry talks given at the edges of the exhibit hall. First up was the Golden Helix talk presented by CEO Andreas Scherer, covering the latest for Varseq as well as general tips for scaling up as a testing lab. Exomes, as expected, are their bread and butter and what they recommend building out from. A portion of the talk was spent on how they prepared a custom solution for Denmark's national genome center. Institutions at that scale have their data airgapped, so they had to send the updates to VarSeq annotations through a DMZ. An upcoming development in Varseq is TSO-500 support - it would be great if this means they have the groundwork for building out solutions for other pan-cancer or multi-cancer panels. 


Metabolon Colab
------
This was a primer on metabolomics from one of the leaders in the field, Metabolon. They didn't mention much I didn't already know despite my very limited knowledge in this area.
